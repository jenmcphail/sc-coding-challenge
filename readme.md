Welcome to the github repo of Jen McPhail's coding challenge for Symphony Commerce. 

##Installation Instructions
To run the app locally, clone this repo and run `npm install` then `npm start` in your CLI to spin up a local server.

##Technologies Used
- Node
- Express
- Angular
- Grunt

##Process
- My process began with planning. I wrote user stories, created wireframes (below), and tracked the progress of each feature with [Trello](https://trello.com/b/Ksj1F6pk/symphony-commerce-coding-challenge).

- I then moved to coding where I set up a simple express server to serve my assets. I also implemented angular through npm to perform an http get request of the API endpoint and display the information dynamically on the front-end. Finally, I created a responsive design with custom CSS and the help of a grunt task manager to auto-prefix and minify my stylesheets.

- My final step was to deploy the site [live to the internet](https://symphony-commerce-challenge.herokuapp.com/).
